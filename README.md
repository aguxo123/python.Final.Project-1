Introduction:

This project is a simple implementation of a URL shortener, developed as part of our programming class. The objective was to apply basic programming concepts to create a functional and efficient tool for shortening long URLs. 


Features:

1. URL Shortening: The main functionality of the tool is to shorten long URLs, making them more manageable and shareable.

2. Customizable Short URLs: Users can choose a custom alias for their shortened URL, making it easy to remember and share.

3. Error Handling: The system is equipped with error handling mechanisms to deal with invalid URLs, custom aliases, and other potential issues.


Concepts Applied from Class:

1. Functions: The core functionalities of shortening URLs, customizing aliases, and tracking access are implemented as separate functions for better code organization.

2. Dictionaries: Dictionaries are used to store the mapping between custom aliases and original URLs, as well as to track access counts.

3. Conditional Statements: Conditions are employed to handle errors, check for the existence of custom aliases, and control the flow of the program.

4. File Handling: The tool may use file handling to store and retrieve data, ensuring persistence of custom aliases and access counts even after restarting the program.


How to Use:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the sURL shortener in your Python environment.
3. Choose to shorten a URL, an existing one.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to input the necessary information.
5. The tool will provide you with the shortened URL or relevant information based on your chosen action.
